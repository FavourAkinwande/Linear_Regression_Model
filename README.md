**Food Waste Prediction Model**

This repository contains the code and resources for a food waste prediction model aimed at predicting the amount of food waste generated by countries based on various input parameters. The model uses machine learning techniques to analyze historical data and predict future waste amounts, assisting in waste reduction and resource optimization at the national level.

**Proeject Objectives**
The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model for estimating the total amount of food waste generated by different countries. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the model will provide valuable insights into food waste generation and assist in resource optimization. The key objectives of the project are:

1. Build a Predictive Model: Develop a machine learning model that predicts the total food waste based on various features.
2. Optimize Model Performance: Implement optimizing techniques to improve model accuracy.
3. Evaluate Model Effectiveness: Assess the performance of the model using appropriate metrics and ensure reliable predictions.
4. Deploy the Model: Create an accessible API that allows users to input relevant data and receive predictions about food waste. 

**Mission**
My mission is to lead the charge in conservation, fueled by my unwavering passion for integrating sustainable and circular economy processes. I am dedicated to spearheading innovative and environmentally responsible projects that make a tangible difference on our planet. With a steadfast commitment to sustainability, I strive to minimize waste, reduce our environmental impact, and promote biodiversity in all my endeavors. I envision a future where my actions today contribute to a world that thrives sustainably for generations to come. This mission inspired the development of the food waste prediction model, aiming to reduce waste and promote sustainability.

**Brief Description of Data**
The dataset used for this project includes food waste data for various countries, with features related to the total combined food waste per capita, household, retail, and food service estimates. These estimates help predict the total food waste generated by countries, which can be used for resource optimization and waste reduction efforts.

**Source of Data:** Kaggle 
**Link to Dataset:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/food-waste?resource=download

**Dataset Features:**
1. Country: The name of the country.
2. combined figures (kg/capita/year): The total combined food waste per capita per year (in kilograms). This is the target variable for the prediction model.
3. Household estimate (kg/capita/year): The estimated food waste per capita per year from households (in kilograms).
4. Household estimate (tonnes/year): The estimated total food waste from households per year (in tonnes).
5. Retail estimate (kg/capita/year): The estimated food waste per capita per year from retail (in kilograms).
6. Retail estimate (tonnes/year): The estimated total food waste from retail per year (in tonnes).
7. Food service estimate (kg/capita/year): The estimated food waste per capita per year from food services (in kilograms).
8. Food service estimate (tonnes/year): The estimated total food waste from food services per year (in tonnes).
9. Confidence in estimate: The level of confidence in the estimates, which can be "Very Low Confidence", "Low Confidence", or other confidence levels.
10. M49 code: The M49 code for countries, used for statistical purposes.
11. Region: The geographical region of the country
12. Source: The source of the data.

## Instructions For Running Mobile App

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FavourAkinwande/Linear_-Regression_Model.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:  
   Navigate to the mobile app directory and install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd food-waste-prediction/mobile-app
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the App**:  
   To run the app locally, use the following command:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The app will launch in your default browser, where you can interact with the food waste prediction model.

4. **Connect with API**:  
   Ensure that your app is connected to the live API for real-time predictions. You can configure the endpoint in the `config.js` file of your mobile app.

## Running Locally (API)

To run the API locally for development purposes:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the API directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/food-waste-prediction.git
   cd food-waste-prediction/api
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Start the API server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
